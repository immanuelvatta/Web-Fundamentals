      #### Things to remember in HTML
      - HTML is the language of the Web. HyperText Markup Language. It is the main markup language for all web pages.
		- HTML is the content of the site
		Purpose: it lets programmers tell the browser the meaning of the content we wish to place on a web page to show users.
		HTML defines a number of tags that we can wrap the contents with.
			§ Headings and paragraphs of text
			§ Images
			§ Links
			§ Lists
			§ Tables
			§ Forms
		HTML tags describe the content they contain.
		
		Opening and closing tags
			Most tags come in pairs: one opening and one closing tag, that denote the beginning and end of content. 
			Ex:
			<body>   </body>
		Tags can encapsulate other tags. This is called nesting. Nested items are intended with a tab.
		
		Syntax: 
		Every HTML web page is composed of elements, which specify different types of content.
		The syntax for indicating the type of element is with tags.

      Parent-Child-Sibling Relationship
		   PCS relationship is just a term to describe the relationship between tags/elements inside an HTML document.

      Divs
		   Block out space
		   <div></div> element exists for us to create a division in our code where we can group tags that have a common purpose together.

      After Writing your HTML code, make sure you Validate your HTML using:
